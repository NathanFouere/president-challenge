# President Challenge

Game project which aims to create configurable and dynamic historical simulations of political and economic events during the 20th century.

## Description

**President Challenge** is a text-based simulation game that puts players in the shoes of a political leader during the 20th century. Players navigate through a series of events, making decisions that shape the course of history. The game is designed to be highly configurable, allowing creator of games to create unique scenarios.

## Architecture

The project is designed following **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** principles.

## Features

- **Event System**: Players navigate through a system of dynamic events, with consequences that affect the state of the game.
- **Class and Party Dynamics**: Social classes and political parties react to the player's decisions based on their ideologies.
- **Economic Management**: Players balance resources, industries, and budgets to maintain stability.
- **Multiple Endings**: Outcomes are shaped by player choices, reflecting different historical and hypothetical scenarios.

## Technologies

### Frameworks
- **AdonisJS**
- **Nuxt**

### Database
- **PostgreSQL**

### DevOps
- **Docker**
- **Docker Compose**
- **GitHub Actions**

## Learning Objectives
I am unsure of finalizing this project, but I have set the following learning objectives:
- **Adonis.js**: Learning AdonisJs to get into the NodeJs ecosystem
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Learning how to structure applications with a focus on the domain logic.
- **Docker**: Learning how to create portable and reproducible development environments.
- **Deployment**: Learning how to set-up production-ready systems and pipelines.

## Roadmap
You can track the progress and upcoming features of this project on the [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/yeDvZUYI/allende-challenge-v2) (In French)

(Globally, the main issues are cleaning up the front-end code, balancing gameplay mechanics, and creating a more usable admin interface.)
